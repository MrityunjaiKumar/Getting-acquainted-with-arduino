What is Arduino
===============
- Arduino is the name of a company that designs and manufacture a series of open-source and easy-to-use hardware kits, powered by Atmega328/Atmega328P microcontrollers.
- These microcontrollers can be used by anyone for electronics prototyping or making cool DIY projects.
- These are very easy to program using the Arduino IDE which is free and open source.

Why Arduino?
=============
- **Open source and extensible hardware**
- **Free and Open Source Software**
- **Inexpensive**
- **Very easy to program :** Via USB and not a serial port.
- **Multi-Platform :** Windows, Linux and Macintosh
- **Large community support**

Difference Between Microprocessor || Microcontroller
====================================================
- Microprocessor is an IC which has only the CPU inside them i.e. only the processing powers.
- Microprocessor cannot be used stand alone. They need other peripherals like RAM, ROM, buffer, I/O ports etc. **Examples of Microprocessors:** Intelâ€™s Pentium 4, core 2 duo, i3, i5, i7 
- Microcontrollers, on the other hand, has a CPU, in addition with a fixed amount of RAM, ROM and other peripherals all embedded on a single chip. At times it is also termed as a mini computer or a computer on a single chip. **Examples of Microcontrollers:** ATMEL AT89 series,ATMega Series, etc.
