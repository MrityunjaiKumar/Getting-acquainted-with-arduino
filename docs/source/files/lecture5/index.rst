Seven Segment Display (SSD) or seven segment Indicator is an electronic device which helps display decimal numerals and English alphabets.

TYPES OF SSD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

COMMON CATHODE SSD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    :align: center
In common cathode all the cathodes are tied to a common pin, in this case generally ground, and the LED are driven by the state of the anodes where ground is off and power is on.

COMMON ANODE SSD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In common anode all the anodes on the display are tied to a common pin, typically the power source, and the LED are controlled via the cathodes with ground being on and power being off.

EXERCISE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- To make a single digit counter
HARDWARE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When we write digital high on pins of arduino the current flows and ledâ€™s are turned on.

SOFTWARE

A basic arduino code will involve two functions for sure: setup and loop. Setup function does not return any value and accepts no parameters. It is used to initialize our hardware. 

Practice Problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Make a four digit counter using four digit seven segment display
